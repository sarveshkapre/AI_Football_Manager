# Agent Guidelines

These instructions apply to all automated agents and contributors working in this repo.

## Core expectations
- Keep `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `AGENTS.md` accurate and current.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for any user-visible change, decision, or milestone.
- If you introduce a new doc or workflow, link it from `README.md`.
- Avoid speculative claims. Match the PRD’s evidence-first stance.

## Documentation workflow
- Product requirements live in `docs/PRD.md`.
- Keep PRD updates incremental and dated in the changelog.
- Use clear, concise language suitable for coaches and analysts.

## Repo hygiene
- Prefer small, focused commits.
- Do not remove or rewrite prior changelog entries.
- Add new sections to the PRD only if they are actionable and agreed.

## When unsure
- Ask for clarification rather than making large assumptions.
