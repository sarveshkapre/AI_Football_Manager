# MVP Backlog (Draft)

## Epics

1. Ingest and processing
- Video upload and decode pipeline

2. Perception pipeline
- Player/ball detection and tracking
- Field registration and spatial normalization
- Signal quality estimation

3. Tactical interpreter
- Tactical event detection (press, overload, switches, transitions)
- Shape and line height estimation
- Confidence scoring and explanations

4. Evidence and overlays
- Clip generator (10–15 seconds)
- Overlays (spacing box, lines, trajectory, entry markers)
- Exportable clips and artifacts

5. Coach Mode

8. Workflow parity
- Fast clipping controls
- Manual tagging + search
- Roles and permissions
- Comments and annotations

## Early milestones
