## Implemented
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Analyst bulk-edit safety: added one-step “Undo bulk edit” for multi-select timeline tag/highlight operations, plus tighter no-op guarding so unchanged bulk actions do not emit misleading audit events. Evidence: `src/ui/web/src/pages/Analyst.tsx`, `src/ui/web/src/App.smoke.test.tsx`; `npm run verify` (pass).
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Reports import UX polish: added `I` hotkey to open import picker, clearer import busy/status messaging, and surfaced the shortcut in hotkey help. Evidence: `src/ui/web/src/pages/Reports.tsx`, `src/ui/web/src/components/HotkeyHelpModal.tsx`, `src/ui/web/src/styles.css`; `npm run verify` (pass).
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Reports import review now shows clip-title previews for new/overlap/removed/notes-changed buckets (counts-first + compact lists), reducing operator ambiguity before apply. Evidence: `src/ui/web/src/pages/Reports.tsx`, `src/ui/web/src/utils/packDiff.ts`, `src/ui/web/src/styles.css`; `npm run verify` (pass).
- [x] 2026-02-11 - Reliability: added deterministic unit coverage for import preview group mapping and overflow semantics. Evidence: `src/ui/web/src/utils/packDiff.test.ts`; `npm run test` (pass).
- [x] 2026-02-10 - Settings backup/restore: added a versioned JSON backup of all `afm.*` localStorage keys plus a restore flow that overwrites AFM local data and reloads to rehydrate state. Evidence: `src/ui/web/src/utils/backup.ts`, `src/ui/web/src/utils/backup.test.ts`, `src/ui/web/src/pages/Settings.tsx`; `npm run verify` (pass).
- [x] 2026-02-10 - Reliability: eliminated Node WebStorage `localStorage` warnings in the happy-dom UI smoke by forcing an in-memory storage implementation, and hardened storage utilities to prefer `window.localStorage` and no-op when unavailable.

- [x] 2026-02-10 - Reports import undo: added a persisted one-step “Undo import” that restores the previous queue + notes snapshot after applying a pack; warns before overwriting if the queue changed since import; clearing the imported-pack banner also clears the undo snapshot. Evidence: `src/ui/web/src/pages/Reports.tsx`, `src/ui/web/src/utils/guards.ts`, `src/ui/web/src/utils/guards.test.ts`, `src/ui/web/src/styles.css`; `npm run verify` (pass).

## Insights
- Corrupted localStorage is a high-likelihood failure mode in long-running prototypes; runtime guards prevented unsafe hydration across every persisted context.
- Segment report generation was difficult to validate while embedded in React state handlers; extracting to `utils/reports.ts` made deterministic unit tests straightforward.
- Enforcing typecheck + tests in CI surfaced latent type mismatches that Vite build alone would not catch.
- Market baseline for matchday tools clusters around rapid clipping/tagging, role-based access, and shareable packs; the prototype’s fastest wins are reliability and workflow polish (access-aware routing, bounded saved searches, crash recovery).
- Market scan (bounded) suggests table-stakes: live tagging/hotkeys, rapid clip assembly, and shareable/permissioned packs with expiry.

- Bounded scan indicates telestration/drawing is explicit table-stakes (arrows/freehand/lines) with “presentational mode” variants (drawings shown only during presentation).

- Offline sharing commonly includes packaged artifacts (video + graphics + notes) rather than single JSON exports; bundling assets into a zip reduces friction for “send to staff” workflows even in a prototype context.
- Market scan (bounded) suggests parity expectations around live collaboration and “shared timelines” for matchday workflows, plus shareable presentations/packs with permissions.

- Market scan (bounded) reinforces that “presentation tooling” is positioned as a first-class workflow (not an export afterthought), including multi-angle/auto-annotations and cloud sharing.

- Bounded market refresh (checked 2026-02-09) continues to emphasize: multi-select/bulk tagging, fast evidence packaging, and persistent context after sharing/importing.

- Bounded market refresh (checked 2026-02-10) highlights import/conflict-control as explicit workflow surface area (merge matching tags; avoid overwriting existing notes) and real-time/shared timeline collaboration as a “table stakes” direction for live capture.

- Bounded market refresh (checked 2026-02-10) reinforces that undo/redo and safe import/migration workflows are explicitly surfaced in video-analysis tooling, and that “packages” are treated as a shareable unit (not just raw files).

- Bounded market refresh (checked 2026-02-11) continues to emphasize import safety and operator review clarity: explicit merge/conflict controls, migration safeguards, and low-friction review of what will change before import apply.
